# Indirect effect
# developed from Scotti et al 2007

# n step effect of species i on species j
# effect of species j on all species aside from species i (the direct effect) multiplied by each species's own effect on species i
# e.g. indirect effect of species b on species a (4 spp. total) = alpha(bc) * alpha (ca) + alpha(bd) * alpha(da)
# each element: sum is the total indirect effects acted upon species a by all other species in network

# use this data if needed
